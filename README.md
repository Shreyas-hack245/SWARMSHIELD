🛡️ SWARMSHIELD
One Photo. One Report. One Step Closer to a Healthier Community.

SWARMSHIELD is an AI-powered public health surveillance platform designed to combat vector-borne diseases like Dengue, Malaria, and Cholera. By empowering citizens to report stagnant water and high-risk areas, we bridge the gap between community awareness and government action.

🚀 The Problem
Stagnant water is a silent killer. In urban and rural areas, undetected water logging becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria. Current reporting methods are slow, manual, and lack real-time tracking, leading to delayed sanitization and preventable outbreaks.

✨ Key Features
Citizen Reporting: Simple interface to upload photos/videos of risk areas with GPS tagging.

AI Risk Assessment: Automatic categorization of reports into Low, Medium, or High risk (Simulated for Demo).

Public Dashboard: A transparent view of all reported areas and their current status.

Officer Portal: A dedicated interface for health officials to track, manage, and mark areas as "Cleaned" with proof.

Real-time Status: Live ticket IDs and status updates to keep the community informed.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Modern CSS Grid & Flexbox, Google Fonts

Icons: Lucide-React / FontAwesome

Design: Mobile-responsive, Gov-Tech professional aesthetic

📸 How It Works
Capture: A citizen takes a photo of stagnant water.

Report: The user uploads the photo via SwarmShield with their location.

Analyze: The platform assigns a Risk Level and generates a unique Ticket ID.

Resolve: Health officers view the report, dispatch a team, and upload a "Post-Cleanup" photo to close the ticket.
